Introduction

Go, also known as Golang, is a fast, efficient, and statically typed language built by Google. It’s especially popular in cloud computing, networking, and distributed systems. This repository serves as a personal reference and record of progress as I learn Go from the basics to more advanced concepts.
Learning Goals

Here are the main topics I aim to cover in this repository:

    Go Basics: Syntax, variables, loops, and conditionals
    Functions: Creating, using, and understanding Go functions
    Data Structures: Arrays, slices, maps, structs
    Concurrency: Goroutines and channels
    Error Handling: Idiomatic error handling in Go
    File Handling: Reading from and writing to files
    Project Work: Building small programs to apply concepts

Projects & Examples

As I work through different topics, I’ll add example code and small projects here:

    Hello World - Basic syntax and setup
    Calculator - Simple arithmetic operations
    To-Do List - Managing a list of tasks with basic CRUD operations
    Weather CLI - Fetching and displaying weather data (planned)

Resources

I’m using a variety of resources to learn Go, including:

    Go by Example
    The Go Programming Language Documentation
    A Tour of Go
    Books: “The Go Programming Language” by Alan Donovan and Brian Kernighan
