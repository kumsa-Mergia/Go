Project Layout: A typical Go project layout consists of multiple directories and files organized by packages. Here’s a sample structure:

"
myproject/

├── go.mod        # Module file

├── go.sum        # Dependency checksum file

├── main.go       # Entry point (main package)

├── pkg/          # Custom packages

│   └── mypackage/

│       └── mypackage.go

└── cmd/                # Sub-packages for command-line tools or binaries

    └── mytool/ 
    
        └── main.go
"
        
Best Practices:

    Keep code organized by placing reusable code in separate packages.
    Use the cmd/ directory for different application entry points.
    Use pkg/ for reusable libraries within your project.
